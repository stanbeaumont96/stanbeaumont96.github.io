<h3>Всем Привет!<br> This page is designed to teach you about verbs of motion in Russian.</h3>


<p>In English conveying going or coming is quite easy. We use context to understand, whether the action was performed by foot or on transport and whether the action was a one time trip, or a round trip. However, in Russian the verb of motion chosen depends on the method of travelling and the completedness of the trip - a one way trip or round trip.
</p>

	    <p> We have already learned that there is an imperfective and perfective form of every verb in Russian, however, verbs of motion are slightly more complicated than this, they have three forms. Two of the forms are imperfective and one of them is perfective. The two imperfective forms vary depending on whether the action is unidirectional or multidirectional.  </p>
	    
	<p>Multi directional verbs of motion are used to express: 
	<li> Repeated journeys - every day I go to school.
	<li> Movement in more than one direction - he ran across the garden. 
        <li> The ability to do a movement in general - people walk and birds fly. </p>
	    
	    <p>Unidirectional verbs are used to express:
	    <li> Movement in one direction, usually on one occasion - I am going to the swimming pool.
	    <li> Movement in a particular direction - Yesterday Aleksi went to a bar and not a restaurant.  	    
	    </p>    
	    
	    <p> Here are some important verbs of motion that you should familiarise yourself with.<br>
the verbs are listed in the order of: imperfective multidirectional, imperfective unidirectional and perfective.

	    <p> Don't worry if this all seems a bit complicated right now, verbs of motion are often considered very challenging by those learning Russian. Over time you will encounter these verbs more often and start to have a good command over which verb to use. You're knowledge will be reinforced by the exercises on the next page.  </p>
