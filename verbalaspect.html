<p>Всем Привет!<br> This page is designed to help you understand verbal aspect in Russian</p>

<h3>What is verbal aspect?
</h3>

<p>The aspect of a verb is determined by whether the action is on going or completed. <br> In the Russian Language there are only three tenses; past, present and future, compared to the 12 in English. However, there are two forms of every verb. Often the two forms are very similar, making it seem strange that one must learn two verbs in Russian for every one verb in English. The two forms of the verb are known as the imperfective and perfective aspect and they are a vital part of the Russian language, without verbal aspect the language would lose a lot of descriptive ability.</p>

      
      
<h3> Imperfective Aspect - Несовершенный вид </h3>

<p> The imperfective form of a verb is used for:<br>
i) A continuous, incomplete action:  
He was reading a book. – He is reading a book. – He will be reading a book. – 
She was reading a book while her mother was cooking in the kitchen.<br>

ii)	A repeated, habitual or frequent action - often signified by adverbial markers, such as:<br>
  
  <li>always – всегда 
  <li>often – часто 
  <li>constantly – постоянно
  <li>every day – каждый день<br>
   <br> 
 It is important to note that the imperfective aspect concentrates on the process of the action
</p>

<h3> Examples of the imperfective aspect <h/3>
  
  <p>Whenever we meet, he talks about his children. – Каждый раз, когда мы встречаемся, он говорит о своих детях.<br>
The children would constantly ask questions. – Дети постоянно задают вопросы.<br>
They will usually take foreign currency from tourists. – Они обычно принимают у туристов иностранную валюту.
</p>  
      
<h3>Perfective Aspect - Совершенный  вид</h3>

<p>The perfective form of a verb is used for a completed, one-time action in past or future:
He watched the film. – He has watched the film. – He had watched the film. – He will watch the film.</p>
